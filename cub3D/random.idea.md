## Menu
- **Main Menu Idea 1**: A rotating cube that changes color as you select different options.
- **Pause Menu Idea**: When the player pauses the game, time slows down, and the menu appears subtly over the game world.
- **Settings Idea**: Dynamic sliders with visual indicators (e.g., light intensity changing for brightness settings).

---

## Gameplay
- **Mechanic 1**: Players can rewind time, but only for objects they’ve interacted with.
- **Mechanic 2**: Gravity changes based on the environment, adding an extra layer of challenge in platforming levels.
- **Combat Idea**: A combo system where moves build momentum, allowing you to pull off larger attacks.

---

## Sound
- **Music Idea**: Interactive soundtrack that adapts to player actions, becoming more intense in battles or more soothing in exploration.
- **Ambient Sound**: Randomized forest sounds (e.g., birds, leaves) that make each exploration session feel different.
- **Menu Sound Idea**: Subtle, calming background hums with audio feedback when navigating menu options.

---

## Objects
- **Object 1**: A floating cube that changes properties based on the player's abilities (e.g., heat, cold, magnetism).
- **Object 2**: A mirror that reflects not only the world but also hidden elements when looked at from certain angles.

---

## Random Game Design
- **Design Idea 1**: The game world changes subtly based on how the player interacts with NPCs, making choices feel impactful.
- **Design Idea 2**: A hidden “luck” stat that influences small details like item drops, rare events, and subtle story changes.
